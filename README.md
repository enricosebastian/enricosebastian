# hello, world ðŸ‘€
I'm Enrico Sebastian Salazar. Currently an undergraduate majoring in electronics engineering, and minoring in software development. 

I dabble mostly in web and mobile apps, but during my breaks, I end up contemplating whether to download Unity (but never do)

### ðŸ“š currently learning

- TensorFlow (Oh boy)
